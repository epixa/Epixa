This is an example application structure using the Epixa library and Zend
Framework.  Modules are stored directly inside the application directory.  The
application (and library) rely on autoloading with the conventions outlined
by the PHP Standards Working Group in PSR-0:

This requires PHP 5.3 and assumes all modules will utilize namespaces.
